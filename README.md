# Other Implementation
It is my first time encountering this kind of work, so I am still learning and surfing how this should work and what should I do properly and accordingly, 
for now it just resulted simple, yet, I will watch more tutorials and learn from different styles of coding to improve this. Under my coding, I use html 
and use a design inside in the style format.
